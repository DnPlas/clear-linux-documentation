Intel速 Clear Containers
#######################

Intel速 Clear Containers is a collection of tools, configurations,
and techniques anchored on an implementation that leverages Intel速
Architecture to optimize container launching and execution workflow.
These optimizations improve speed, size, and efficiency while offering
a number of benefits that can be derived only from hardware-backed
virtual machines (hardware-enforced isolation and security, for
example) on Intel速 VT technology.

These methods are applied across all levels of the host/virtual machine
hierarchy: from the host-side userland software stack down through the host
Linux* kernel, and into the client-side kernel and userland.

Although it is available as a standalone offering, the Clear Containers
technology works best when it is able to leverage optimizations designed
into the Clear Linux Project.

Customers can integrate all or parts of Intel Clear Containers into a
container infrastructure.
