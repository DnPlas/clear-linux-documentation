WordPress\* use case tutorial
#############################

Welcome to our WordPress use case tutorial. The objective of the tutorial is
to guide you from bare metal to a fully realized WordPress website using
|CLOSIA|.

For your convenience, we have split this tutorial in three different
sections. If your system is already running |CL|, you can skip the bare metal
installation tutorial. Similarly, you can skip ahead to the WordPress
tutorial if you have already have a |CL| based :abbr:`LAMP (Linux, Apache,
MySQL, PHP)` web server.
