Installing the OS as host
#########################

Running Clear Linux\* OS for IntelÂ® Architecture natively on a system is
easy with the installer image. To get started you'll need the following:

* A USB stick flashed with the `installer image`_.  For instructions on how
  to do this, see :ref:`creating_bootable_usb`.
* A host machine running :ref:`supported_hardware`.
* Network access via DHCP.

Installing Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture to a target system
===================================================================

#. Configure the BIOS; this may involve changing the priority of the boot
   device to boot from USB port first.
#. Insert the USB device that is flashed with the
   `installer image`_ into the target system, then reboot.
#. The installer user interface will appear. Once all appropriate configuration
   options have been chosen, the installer will install the OS.

The entire installation should take no more than a few minutes.
