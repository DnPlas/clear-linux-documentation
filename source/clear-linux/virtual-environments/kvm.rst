Using KVM
#########

The easiest way to get started in a virtualized environment is to download
a recent KVM image from the `images`_ directory. Here you'll find a kvm
image file, the UEFI firmware helper, and the KVM start helper script.

Please ensure you have enabled `Intel速 Virtualization Technology
<http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/virtualization/virtualization-technology/intel-virtualization-technology.html>`_
(Intel速 VT) and `Intel速 Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O
<https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-virtualization-technology-for-directed-io-vt-d-enhancing-intel-platforms-for-efficient-virtualization-of-io-devices>`_
(Intel速 VT-d) in your BIOS/UEFI firmware configuration.

Starter script
==============

To start the image, run the `qemu shell script`_ available in the
`images`_ directory.

SSH is needed for remote logins; however, SSH not enabled by default. To enable
it, log in through serial console with the username ``root``. After setting the
password, enable root login via SSH by configuring :file:`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
with this line::

    PermitRootLogin yes

Now you may connect from host via SSH through 2223::

    $ ssh -p 10022 root@localhost

Alternatively, there are a few other ways to approach this.

*  To run the script without modifying its permissions::

   $ bash start_qemu.sh clr_image

*  To run it as a background process::

   $ bash start_qemu.sh clr_image &

*  If you'd like to run the script with execute permission::

   $ chmod +x start_qemu.sh
   $ ./start_qemu.sh clr_image

*  And to run it as a background process::

   $ ./start_qemu.sh clr_image &

If you run into any trouble with qemu getting locked up, try editing the `qemu shell script`_
and removing the ``aio=threads``
